This is my Public Repository for Telling Stories with Data Fall 2020 Mini 2


# About me 
My name is Becca Eige (she/her/hers). I am currently a student in the Telling Stories with Data Fall Mini 2 Course. I am getting my masters in health care policy and management. I graduated from The University of Massachusetts, Amherst with a Bachelor of Arts in English & Economics. While attending The University of Massachusetts, Amherst, I worked in multiple community organizations including the YMCA and the local school system. Additionally, within my economic studies I completed an Economic Undergraduate Research Assistantship, providing analysis and research on the teacher deserts in Boston, Massachusetts. After graduation and prior to coming to CMU I worked as a strategic growth analyst at a medical company outside of Boston, MA. While at that company I was able to use a lot of data visualization and cleaning tools like Qlik, Tableau, and a few others. This drove my interest in data visualization and the importance of good practice in the real world. 

## What I hope to Learn
I hope that this course will help me more preceisely visual data and tell my story better. I also hope that through this class I learn of the importance of data visualization within other industries and across multiple disciplines. After graduation I hope to work with in the health care field, most likely where community and medicine intersect. Thus, the use of data visualization and understanding of data vizualtion will be an invaluable skill in my career.
